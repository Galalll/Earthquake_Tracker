# Earthquake_Tracker
Welcome to our earthquake tracking website! Enter a location and we'll take you there using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) geocoding API.
Then, using the USGS earthquake API, we'll display earthquakes that have occurred near that location, sorted by distance.
Our website provides information on each earthquake, including distances from your location.
Click on each earthquake to view additional details, such as Population and Country name.
We are committed to providing accurate information on earthquakes.
Our website is updated regularly with the latest data from the USGS earthquake API.
Thank you for using our earthquake tracking website. We hope it helps keep you informed and safe.
